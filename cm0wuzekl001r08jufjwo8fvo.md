## The big three of cloud computing platforms:

## AWS, GCP, and Azure ‚òÅÔ∏è

Cloud Computing has revolutionized the way organizations handle digital operations. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are the three cloud service providers dominating the cloud market worldwide. Each offers a unique set of features and services, catering to different business needs. Let's explore the differences among these cloud service providers! üöÄ

## 1\. Overview of Each Provider üåç

### 1.1 AWS (Amazon Web Services) :

The current market leader is Amazon Web Services, a subsidiary of [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com), Inc. It is the most mature cloud platform and offers a wide range of services to individual developers, small and large enterprises, and governments.

AWS started its life as an internal cloud platform. It evolved into a publicly available, on-demand internet computing resource in 2006, offering services like Amazon S3 cloud storage and elastic compute cloud (EC2). AWS now offers more than 200 fully featured services to millions of users. It rakes in one of every three dollars spent on cloud services, with an annual growth rate of 37%, according to figures published in the Register. It delivered 54% of Amazon‚Äôs total operating income in 2023. AWS launched in 2006, is the pioneer of cloud services. It offers a vast array of services, including computing power, storage options, and machine learning capabilities.

### 1.2 Azure (Microsoft Azure) :

Microsoft Azure is the second-largest cloud platform, but is growing faster than AWS with an annual growth rate of 46%, again as measured in The Register. Microsoft has reported cloud revenue growth of 30% for the quarter ending December 31, 2023. Azure has expanded since its 2010 launch to offer over 200 products and services.

Azure, an offering of Microsoft, is particularly tailored to support Microsoft-centric enterprises. Moving to the cloud or a hybrid-cloud environment is easier for these organizations. Azure is not limited to Windows-based services. It also supports open-source languages, technologies, and platforms, giving anyone the freedom to build and support any application. Launched in 2010, Azure integrates seamlessly with Microsoft products, making it a popular choice for businesses already using Microsoft software.

### 1.3 GCP (Google Cloud Platform) :

Compared to AWS vs Azure, GCP is the smallest of the big three cloud providers. That said, it is the fastest growing, with a 54% market share growth rate, *The Register* reports. The company expects the business to grow 20% in 2024.

The GCP currently offers over 200 services spanning computing, networking, big data, and more. Today, GCP consists of services including Google Workspace, enterprise Android, and Chrome OS. It introduced in 2008, leverages Google‚Äôs strengths in data analytics and machine learning. It's known for its high-performance computing and vast network infrastructure.
