### 1\. Introduction and Overview:

This session is about network observability for the Solutions Architect Track. It explains why network observability is important, the difference between monitoring and observability, and the AWS services that help with network observability.

* **<mark>Role Play and Network Observability</mark>:** Role play between an AWS technical person and a customer, discussing network complexity and observability needs, followed by an introduction to network observability concepts.
    
* **<mark>AWS Network Observability Services</mark>:** Explanation of AWS network components like VPC and subnets, the importance of understanding AWS-specific network modifications, and an introduction to AWS services for network observability.
    
* **<mark>Monitoring vs. Observability</mark>:** Differences between monitoring and observability: Monitoring is reactive, while observability is proactive. Observability is crucial for root cause analysis.
    
* **<mark>Components of Network Observability</mark>:** Collection of metrics and logs, monitoring with alarms and dashboards, and analysis with traffic mirroring and reachability analyzer.
    

### 2\. Collection of Data & Analysis

The network observability is focusing on collecting and analyzing network data. It explains near real-time data collection, customization options, and using AWS services for monitoring and logging.

* **<mark>Near real-time data collection</mark>:** Data collection is near real-time with a slight delay, has no performance impact on the system, and is aggregated every 1 minute.
    
* **<mark>Customization options</mark>:** Network observability focuses on near real-time data collection with customizable options for log formats, field selection, and enrichment using AWS services, all without impacting system performance.
    
* **<mark>Boundary VPC concept</mark>:** Centralizes communication for monitoring, simplifies control and monitoring, and is a custom term, not an AWS service.
    
* **<mark>Creating and managing flow logs</mark>:** Steps to create flow logs in AWS include using CloudWatch Logs for data storage and creating roles and policies for permissions.
    

### 3\. Network Logs in Observability

Network Observability is more focusing on AWS services like flow logs, traffic mirroring, and visualization tools. It explains how to capture, analyze, and visualize network traffic for better monitoring and troubleshooting.

* **<mark>Understanding flow logs</mark>:** Use the documentation and enrich the logs, and proper flow of log structure can be applied.
    
* **<mark>Integration and visualization</mark>:** Using Kibana, you can create dashboards to identify top IP sources and destinations and build visualizations for analysis.
    
* **<mark>Traffic mirroring</mark>:** Traffic mirroring involves replicating packets for analysis, which is useful for content inspection and threat monitoring.
    
* **<mark>Filtering and targeting</mark>:** Customizing data capture involves using filters to focus on specific traffic and choosing options for target instances and load balancing.
    
* **<mark>Practical demonstration</mark>:** Setting up traffic mirroring in AWS involves using TCP dump for packet capture and creating and managing mirror sessions.
