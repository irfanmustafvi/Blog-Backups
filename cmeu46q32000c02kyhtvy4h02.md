## Introduction:

Just five years ago, Kubernetes was still an experiment for most organizations. Today? It's mission-critical infrastructure powering everything from traditional workloads to AI at scale.

The 2025 State of Production Kubernetes report from Spectro Cloud dropped some fascinating insights that I think every platform engineer should pay attention to:

## ü§ñ **AI is the new growth engine**:

90% of organizations expect their AI workloads on Kubernetes to grow over the next 12 months. We're not just talking about running containers anymore‚Äîwe're orchestrating intelligence.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è **Multi-cloud is the new normal**:

The average adopter now runs clusters across 5+ environments. From hyperscalers to on-prem and GPU clouds, placement is driven by AI needs and strategic multicloud approaches.

## üí∞ **The cost paradox**:

While 88% report rising Kubernetes TCO year-over-year, 92% are investing in AI-powered optimization tools to bring costs under control. The problem is also becoming the solution.

## üèóÔ∏è **Platform engineering delivers**:

Teams that centralize application deployment through platform engineering functions consistently outperform on key DevOps metrics around reliability and speed.

What strikes me most is how this reflects the maturation we've seen in our industry. Five years ago, we were figuring out basic container orchestration. Now we're using Kubernetes as the foundation for AI-powered platforms that can self-optimize and predict their own issues.

## Call To Action:

**For those running production Kubernetes today: Are you seeing similar trends in your organization? How are you balancing the cost pressures with the need to scale AI workloads?**

## Summary

The tech landscape is evolving rapidly, with multi-cloud environments becoming the norm as organizations run clusters across diverse settings to meet AI needs. Despite rising Kubernetes TCO, many are investing in AI-powered tools to manage costs, turning the problem into a solution. Platform engineering is proving effective, enhancing reliability and speed in application deployment. This progress highlights the industry's growth from basic container orchestration to sophisticated AI-driven platforms. For those using Kubernetes, are you noticing these trends, and how are you managing cost pressures while scaling AI workloads?
